  <h1>Easy Honey Garlic Salmon</h1>
  <img src="https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Browned-Butter-Honey-Garlic-Salmon-IMAGE-1-768x1152.jpg"> 
  <p>The browned butter mixed through that honey garlic sauce is what makes that salmon recipe stand out from the rest. However, there comes a time when people want to keep things simple, and there’s nothing wrong with simplifying a recipe! </p>
  <p>This salmon gets cooked right in the sauce. There’s no searing or frying first. Why? Because a lot of people get anxiety at the thought of frying then flipping salmon and having the fillets fall apart on them halfway through cooking. To get the same crispy edges from searing, you’re going to broil your fillets for a couple more minutes once the salmon is half way done, </p>
  <h4>Ingrediens</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>4 wild caught salmon fillets about 1/2 pound or 250 grams each, skin off or on</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika (mild, sweet or smokey)</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or minced</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons honey</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice, (plus extra to serve)</li>
    <li>Lemon wedges to serve</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Arrange oven shelf to the middle of your oven. Preheat oven to broil/grill settings on medium heat.</li>
    <li>Season salmon with salt, pepper and paprika. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat the butter in a skillet or pan over medium-high heat until melted. Add the garlic and sauté for about a minute, until fragrant. Pour in the honey, water and soy sauce; allow the flavours to heat through and combine. Add in the lemon juice; stir well to combine all of the flavours together.</li>
    <li>Add the salmon steaks to the sauce in the pan; cook each fillet (skin-side down if there's any skin) for 3-4 minutes or until golden, while basting the tops with the pan juices. Season with salt and pepper, to taste (if desired).</li>
    <li>Optional -- Add the lemon wedges around the salmon (adds a stronger lemon taste). 
        <br/>Baste salmon one more time then transfer the pan to your oven to broil / grill for a further 5-6 minutes, or until the tops of the salmon are nicely charred, and the salmon is cooked to your liking.</li>
    <li>To serve, drizzle with the sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with steamed vegetables; over rice or with a salad.</li>
    <li></li>Roast uncovered for 30 minutes for a small turkey under 13 pounds (6 1/2 kg), or 45 minutes for a larger turkey over 14 pounds (7 kg plus).</li>
    <li>Turn turkey over (breast-side up) with a pair of tongs, a clean tea towel or oven mits (heat-proof gloves) and baste with pan juices.</li>
    <li>Spread half of the reserved herb butter over the top of your turkey with a spoon or brush (be careful, the turkey will be hot and the butter will melt nicely over the skin). Pour any remaining juices over your turkey.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to 325°F |165°C (for standard ovens), or 300°F | 150°C (fan-forced). Roast, uncovered, for an hour.</li>
    <li>Slather turkey generously with remaining butter and roast for 30 minutes. Baste again, then continue roasting for a further 30 minutes or so, depending on the size of your bird. *Tent loosely with foil if starting to brown too fast.*
        (For an extra large turkey, you may need an additional half hour to an hour.)</li>
    <li>For extra crispy skin, broil (or grill) in the last 5-10 minutes, keeping your eye on it so it doesn't burn, until the skin is crispy and golden browned all over.</li>
    <li>Tent turkey with foil and allow it to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving and serving.</li>
    <li>Remove 2 1/2 cups of the liquid from the pan juices (top up with stock if you need too), strain and reserve for your gravy.</li>
  </ol>
