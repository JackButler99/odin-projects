  <h1>Roast Turkey</h1>
  <img src="https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Roast-Turkey-Recipe-IMAGE-34-768x1152.jpg"> 
  <p>One of our most loved and favoured holiday dinner is a juicy roast turkey. With each Thanksgiving through the years, my mother learned the art of roasting turkey and became well-known for her succulent roasts.</p>
  <p>We create our own ‘roasting rack’ with garlic heads halved horizontally, so some of the flavoured pan juices cook right into the breast from the outside keeping it moist. The white meat roasts away from the heating element, preventing your turkey from drying out.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <h5>Roasted Turkey</h5>
  <ul> 
    <li>12 pound (6 kg) whole turkey, skin on (fully defrosted, washed, giblets and neck removed)</li>
    <li>3 heads garlic cut in half horizontally divided</li>
    <li>3 slices lemon divided</li>
    <li>6 sprigs thyme divided</li>
    <li>6 sprigs rosemary divided</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil divided</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Herb Butter</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>4 ounces (125 g) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>Salt </li>
    <li>Cracked Pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425°F | 220°C for standard ovens, or 390°F | 200°C for fan forced. Lower oven shelf to the lowest part of your oven.</li>
    <li>Combine the Herb Butter ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Reserve half of the herb butter in the refrigerator for later.</li>
    <li>Line a large roasting pan with foil or parchment paper. Arrange the 4 halves of garlic cut-side down on the bottom of the pan with 4 sprigs each of thyme and rosemary, half of the olive oil and 1 slice of lemon.</li>
    <li>Thoroughly pat turkey dry with paper towels. Stuff with the remaining heads garlic halves, lemon slice, a squeeze of lemon from remaining slice, herbs and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter and rub all over the turkey, including under the skin. Season generously all over with salt and pepper. Place turkey on top of the garlic and herbs in the pan BREAST-SIDE DOWN. Drizzle with the remaining oil.</li>
